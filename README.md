# Leonardo Taquece

Product Manager focused on CRM, data and system-level thinking.

This GitHub is my safe space to document side projects, learning logs, and technical notes that help me be a better PM — more effective with dev teams and grounded in system design.

### What you'll find here:
- Learning logs from exploring front-end, APIs, CRM systems and analytics tools
- Notes on CRM architecture and integration patterns
- Power BI dashboards and data structure breakdowns
- Templates and artifacts from my product workflows (specs, templates, process diagrams)
- Side projects (who knows, might code)

Note: This isn’t a developer portfolio. It’s a working notebook of a technical-minded PM.
